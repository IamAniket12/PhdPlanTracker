# PhD Weekly Plan: Week 5 
## Aniket Dixit


## Goals


- Review a paper and write a detailed analysis of it. ✅
- Finalize the business case for the dollhouse (finding the appropriate materials is taking more time than expected).  ⏳
- Research companies and industries working on cost-effective energy systems. ✅
- Integrate RC car with a Raspberry Pi and test it within the Donkey Car simulator's custom environment. ⏳ 
- Develop and implement an LSTM model using PyTorch on a sample dataset.✅
- Solve one data structure and algorithm problem on LeetCode daily, dedicating 30 minutes each day. ✅

## Notes
- Review the paper and reformat it as well. Answered previous comments as well [Link] (https://www.overleaf.com/project/65be996ac67fb55975bf6b98)
- The LSTM model has been created, and the code will be committed to GitHub soon.
- The RC car has been tested with the Raspberry Pi, the servo is working fine, but the motor's duty cycle needs adjustment. The Raspberry Pi seems very slow.
