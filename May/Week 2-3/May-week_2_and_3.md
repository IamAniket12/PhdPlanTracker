# PhD Weekly Plan: Week (2/3) (10 May - 21 May) 
## Aniket Dixit


## Goals
- Join PGR Training Week. ‚úÖ 
- Master the concepts of Attention, Transformers, and Large Language Models (LLMs). ‚ùå
- Write literature review for one paper, also covering relevant topics from the learning material. ‚ùå
- Ensure the RC Car is prepared for the experiment and set up Raspberry Pi integration. ‚è≥
- Configure the Pi crawler and implement voice cloning, object avoidance, and facial recognition. ‚è≥
- Solve a minimum of 20 Leetcode problems focusing on data structures to improve problem-solving abilities.‚è≥



## Supervisor Suggestions/comments

- All is fine but a bit overambitious. Make sure the priority order is right. The PGR training week should be your top priority for example. (Corrected)
- You might want to check your naming convention. Putting & in filenames may cause you problems later on. (Corrected)


## Notes
 - Monday to Thursday joined all pgr training sessions (except one morning sessionüò¢).
 - Friday and Monday spend whole day on Pi Crawler assembly it took more time than expected.
 - The assembly of the Pi Crawler is nearly complete. Next, I will focus on developing and experimenting with algorithms.
 - The RC car setup is almost complete. Once we check the steering servo issue, we can start integrating it with the Donkey Car simulator.
 - Solved 10 Leetcode problems to improve problem solving.
