- Solve a minimum of 20 Leetcode problems focusing on data structures to improve problem-solving abilities.



## Supervisor Suggestions/comments

- All is fine but a bit overambitious. Make sure the priority order is right. The PGR training week should be your top priority for example. (Corrected)
- You might want to check your naming convention. Putting & in filenames may cause you problems later on. (Corrected)
