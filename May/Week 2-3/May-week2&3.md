# PhD Weekly Plan: Week (2/3) (10 May - 21 May) 
## Aniket Dixit


## Goals
- Master the concepts of Attention, Transformers, and Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Configure the Pi crawler and implement voice cloning, object avoidance, and facial recognition.
- Ensure the RC Car is prepared for the experiment and set up Raspberry Pi integration.
- Solve a minimum of 20 Leetcode problems focusing on data structures to improve problem-solving abilities.
- Write literature review for one paper, also covering relevant topics from the learning material.
- Join PGR Training Week.

## Supervisor Suggestions/comments

- All is fine but a bit overambitious. Make sure the priority order is right. The PGR training week should be your top priority for example. 
- You might want to check your naming convention. Putting & in filenames may cause you problems later on.
